# MoMo Insights Dashboard

Transforming Mobile Money SMS into Meaningful Insights  

---

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and development of an **enterprise-level fullstack application** for analyzing Mobile Money (MoMo) SMS data.  

The system processes XML data, cleans and categorizes it, stores it in a relational database, and presents it on a **frontend dashboard** with tables and charts for easy analysis.  

This project also emphasizes **collaborative workflows** through GitHub, Scrum, and Agile practices.  

---

## Objectives
- Parse and process MoMo SMS data in XML format.
- Clean, normalize, and categorize transaction data.
- Store processed data in a **relational database** (SQLite/MySQL).
- Build a frontend dashboard to visualize and analyze financial activity.
- Practice collaborative development with GitHub + Scrum board.

---

## Features
- **Backend (ETL pipeline):**
  - Parse XML files from MoMo.
  - Clean and normalize transaction data.
  - Categorize transactions (Cash-In, Cash-Out, Payment, Airtime, Fees).
  - Save to relational database.
  - Export processed data to JSON for frontend use.

- **Database:**
  - SQLite/MySQL schema for structured data storage.
  - Tables for transactions, logs, and categories.

- **Frontend:**
  - Clean HTML/CSS/JS dashboard interface.
  - Interactive tables for browsing transaction history.
  - Data visualizations (charts, trends, spending breakdowns).

- **Collaboration:**
  - GitHub repository for version control.
  - Scrum board for task tracking.
  - Agile workflow with backlog, sprint tasks, and deliverables.
